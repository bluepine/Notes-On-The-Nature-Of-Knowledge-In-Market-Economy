Notes On The Nature Of Knowledge In Market Economy (WIP)
===============	
 
The anatomy of knowledge:
observation -> induction -> assumption -> logical reasoning -> conclusion -> testing.
 
Knowledge is inseparable from its production process. Hence the importance of epistemology.
 
Testing: falsification and risky validation.

No knowledge can be proven true absolutely. 
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_that_I_know_nothing]
 
Human's perception of truth can lead to to a self-reenforcing cycle, which keeps validating the perceived truth until it can no longer do so.

The assumption of a logical reasoning is also a piece of knowledge, which cannot be proven true absolutely. Usually the truthfulness of the assumption is determined by a number of competing factors, which tend to change over time.

Over time, the market tends to exhaust the factors contributing to the truthfulness of an assumption and amplify the factors contributing to the truthfulness of different assumptions, causing paradoxical fluctuation of the truthfulness of assumptions. 
* [https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0402651]
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Logic_of_Collective_Action]

If we can construct and validate quantitative models that capture the dynamics of different factors contributing to the truthfulness of an assumption, we would have gained a deeper level of understanding of the knowledge that is based upon said assumption. However this is not always feasible. In turn, empirical heuristics are often employed. Human society tends to form fitness selection mechanisms for these heuristics, which could have drastic consequences.

Despite the existence of rational reasoning in favor of being the minority in many game scenarios, herd behavior continues to exist.

Correlation does not imply causation.

logical reasoning = proof
 
proof = program [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence]
 
program = function [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus]
 
A computer program is a piece of logical reasoning which requires very little effort on testing its assumptions. The basic assumption of every computer program is that the computer which executes it will function as expected, which is the essential point of digital computing.
 
Interpersonal communication, on the other hand, is a piece of logical reasoning which requires a lot of effort on testing its assumptions, which are other people's subconscious pattern and state, and their assignment of the probability of truthfulness on various pieces of knowledge. Under this view, the words spoken during interpersonal communication is only a small part of the logical reasoning.

The production of knowledge requires effort in all of its three stages: coming up with an assumption from observations, construction of logical reasoning, validation of conclusion. The distribution of efforts on these three parts may vary, leading to different skill sets in the knowledge production process, which in turn leads to the necessity of teamwork.
